# EIDOLON - QUANTUM TELEPORTATION

Eidolon-Quantum Teleportation, a Simulation of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. 
Eidolon translates to the word phantom in ancient Greece.
The web application hosted on streamlit talks about how two lovers Orpheus, on Earth, and Eurydice, in the underworld, send a message(Eidolon) to each other. The project demonstrates quantum entanglement between three qubits, the basic property which was proved in 2022. 
I have tried to create a messy circuit or a bad circuit , which signifies the prevention or obstacles that Eidolon has to face before reaching Eurydice. There are 2 slide parameters - theta or the message and noise - information disruption parameter.
By increasing the noise, we see that the purity of the message decreases, which suggests information loss. The state of q0(the initial message) and q2(the message that eurydice receives) is exactly the same in case of an ideal state(no noise and a perfect circuit). But this is a simulation of a real-world scenario, and hence, the loss of information
